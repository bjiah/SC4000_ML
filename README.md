This project aims to develop a robust sentiment classification model to determine whether each movie
review expresses a positive or negative sentiment. Accurately classifying sentiments in textual data like movie
reviews is crucial in understanding audience reactions and opinions, and it has applications in
recommendation systems, marketing analysis, and customer feedback interpretation.
The movie review dataset used in this project consists of 8,530 reviews for training, 1,066 for validation, and
1,066 for testing. To achieve an accurate and high-performing sentiment classification model, we follow a
structured methodology. Section 2 covers data preprocessing and the preparation of word embeddings. In
Section 3, we introduce our baseline Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, outlining its structure, initial
performance results, and the optimal configurations after fine-tuning hyperparameters. Building on this
baseline, Section 4 explores various enhancement techniques to improve the modelâ€™s accuracy and
robustness, including out-of-vocabulary (OOV) handling, advanced architectures, and transfer learning.
